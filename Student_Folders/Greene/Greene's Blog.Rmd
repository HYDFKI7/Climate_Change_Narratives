#### TMAX Has No Significant Change

Even though the slope on the temperature maximum graph is actually decreasing (meaning DC has gotten cooler), this correlation only has a p- value of .7895 which means that it is not significant. Monthly analysis also reveal that no months have changes in temperature maximums.


```{r, TMAX plot, echo=FALSE}
climate_data <- read.csv("/home/CAMPUS/jagc2019/JacobGreene_WashingtonDC_Data.csv")
strDates <- as.character(climate_data$DATE)
climate_data$NewDate <- as.Date(strDates, "%Y-%m-%d")
plot(TMAX~NewDate, climate_data,type='l', main= "Washington D.C. Daily Temperature Maximum vs Time", xlab= "Time", ylab= "Daily Temperature Maximum (C)")
bestfitline.lm = lm(TMAX~NewDate, data = climate_data)
coef(bestfitline.lm)
abline(coef(bestfitline.lm), col="red", lwd=2)
summary(bestfitline.lm)
```


#### TMIN Temperatures Have Increased

While there is not a significant temperature maximum change, there is a very significant p value of 1.23^-10 for daily temperature minimums since 1950. The positive slope on this graph indicates that in DC daily temperature minimums have gotten warmer.

```{r TMIN plot, echo=FALSE}
plot(TMIN~NewDate, climate_data,type='l', main= "Washington D.C. Daily Temperature Minimum vs Time", xlab= "Time ", ylab= "Daily Temperature Minimum (C)")
TMINbestlinefit.lm=lm(TMIN~NewDate, data = climate_data)
abline(coef(TMINbestlinefit.lm), col= "red",lwd=2)
summary(TMINbestlinefit.lm)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
