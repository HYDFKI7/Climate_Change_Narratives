## Introduction

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, echo=FALSE}
summary(cars)
file.path = "/home/CAMPUS/erta2020/EleanorTahbaz_NY,NY region_data.csv"
climate_data = read.csv("/home/CAMPUS/erta2020/EleanorTahbaz_NY,NY region_data.csv")
str(climate_data)
strDates <-as.character(climate_data$DATE)
climate_data$NewDate <-as.Date(strDates, "%m/%d/%Y")
plot(TMAX~DATE, climate_data)
## This is a plot

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
