<h4>I hope to write about weather trends in Salt Lake City, Utah. I have not decided  what I would like to look into specifically, but perhaps something with snowmelt trends would be interesting, as that is where a large amount of the city's water comes from. I also might want to look at how changing climate trends affect animal behavior. </h4>

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
climate_data = read.csv("/home/CAMPUS/edab2019/Climate_Change_Narratives/Data/FA20/Duggleby_SaltLakeCity_data.csv")
strDates <- as.character(climate_data$DATE)
climate_data$NewDate <- as.Date(strDates, "%Y-%m-%d")
date = climate_data$NewDate
tmax=climate_data$TMAX
snow=climate_data$SNOW
