## Overview

This blog will evaluate the effect of climate change on summers and winters in the Salt Lake Valley and resulting implications for water resources, air pollution, recreational revenues, and environmental justice efforts.

Climate change is transforming the landscape of the Salt Lake Valley in Utah. Several peer-reviewed articles examine the impact that anthropogenic burning of fossil fuels has on local ecology, water resources, air quality, and snowpack. Climate change has created a trend of rising temperatures across the seasons in Utah, yielding several dire ecological, economic, and social implications.
A recent study by premiere climatologists in Zurich, Switzerland analyzed the level of impact climate change has exerted on the Northern Hemisphere (Bastin, 2019). The study projects that average temperatures in Salt Lake City summers are likely to increase by 10 degrees Fahrenheit in the next 30 years. Thus, Salt Lake Valley summers may begin to feel closer to Las Vegas’s current scorching heat, increasing an average of 90 degrees to 100 degrees Fahrenheit.

  Climate change will likely impact snowpack as winters warm. Snowpack is a critical resource for Salt Lake City, serving as a water resource for millions and an economic powerhouse in facilitating revenues from ski resorts (Seidel, 1998). Daily observation of snowpack telemetry (SNOTEL) data from 1981 to 2007 indicate that the overall level of snowfall has decreased significantly in the Great Salt Lake Basin (Bedford, 2007). This decreases the opportunity for the wintertime recreation and increases the chances of late-summer water shortages that are particularly potent as the population of the valley is rapidly increasing. As winters continue to warm, this issue will continue to worsen. 

  Climate change is also correlated with increasing levels of air quality damages. Utah’s Wasatch Front has been notorious for trapping particulates, far exceeding the federal air quality standards set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This dire situation has led to a litany of health complications, including, but not limited to, asthma, cardiac diseases, and, “an average of 200 Utahns [sent] to the hospital with severe pneumonia each year” (Pirozzi, 2017).  EPA defined “orange” and “red” risk days are extremely dangerous, but even “green” days perpetuate higher risks of death among the elderly in the Salt Lake Valley (Di, 2017). 

  To supplement this literature on cliamte change damages for the Salt Lake City populace, I analyzed temperature trend data in the Salt Lake Valley from 1942 to 2020 using the Salt Lake International Airport Weather Station. I analyzed summer temperature data as well as winter temperature data and snowfall data. The results indicate a significant increase in summer temperatures, increase in winter temperatures, and decrease in overall snowfall, supporting literature that these weather anomalies in Utah are climate change caused.

#### January is cold (but getting less so)!

In Utah, it appears that our winter months have experienced warming. As such, I am going to drill down on the month of January. I've plotted January data below and have created a best-fit line (linear model/ordinary least squares model) for monthly January averages of daily `TMAX` against year to see if there is some type of discernible trend.

Based on my analysis, my data indicate that there is  a trend of increasing temperature in Salt Lake City for the month of July, rejecting the null hypothesis. (slope = 0.019, r2 = 0, p-value = 0.024).
```{r July TMAXPlot, echo=FALSE}
month_i <- 7
plot(TMAX~YEAR, data=MonthlyTMAXMean[MonthlyTMAXMean$MONTH==month_i,],ty='l', xlim=c(1950, 2020), ylab="Maximum Average July Temperature")
July.lm <- lm(TMAX~YEAR, data=MonthlyTMAXMean[MonthlyTMAXMean$MONTH==month_i,])
summary(July.lm)
abline(coef(July.lm), col="red")
```
Based on my analysis, my data indicate that there is not a trend of increasing temperature in Salt Lake City for the month of January, failing to reject the null hypothesis (slope = 0.0435, r2 = 0, p-value = 0.29).
```{r Jan TMIN Plot, echo=FALSE}

Based on my analysis, my data indicate that there is a trend of decreasing snowfall in Salt Lake City for the month of January, rejecting the null hypothesis (slope = -0.0488, r2 = 0.2271, p-value = 0.02).
