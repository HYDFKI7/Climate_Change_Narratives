## Introduction

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r readdata}
# Data path from marc's username...
filepath = "/home/CAMPUS/mwl04747/github/Climate_Change_Narratives/Data/FA20/Williams_SaltLakeCityUT_data.csv"

# make sure to uncomment out when you get the file back!
filepath = "/home/CAMPUS/bawa2018/Climate_Change_Narratives/Data/FA20/Williams_SaltLakeCityUT_data.csv"
climate_data = read.csv(filepath)
strDates <- as.character(climate_data$DATE)
climate_data$NewDate <- as.Date(strDates, "%Y-%m-%d")
```


## plot daily data

added a section for a new part of the process...I changed the predictor from DATE to NewDate -- we created the new date so that we could actually plot the data using the corrrectly formatted data! I made the symbol smaller to make it "cleaner" looking, what do you think?

```{r plotdailyTMAX}
#plot(TMAX~DATE, climate_data, pch = 16, cex = 1.3, col = "blue")
plot(TMAX~NewDate, climate_data, pch = 16, cex=.2, col = "blue")


#TMAX.lm = lm(TMAX ~ DATE, data = climate_data) #this won't work because you have the wrong variable DATE instead of NewDate

#coef(TMAX.lm)
#abline(coef(TMAX.lm))
```
