### Background on fires and air quality in portland oregon

In this project, I plan to explore the correlation between Portland's average change in temperature, Portland's changes in percipitation, and Portland's air quality for the months of August and September (wildfire season). For my background , I will describe the research done linking wildfires and climate change, and I will describe some of the effects of bad air quality.

### Graphs of yearly percipiation

### Graphs of average temperature change


```{r temp, echo = FALSE}
climate_data <-read.csv("/home/CAMPUS/cjld2018/Climate_Change_Narratives/Data/FA20/claireleblanc_portland_data.csv")
strDates <- as.character(climate_data$DATE)
climate_data$NewDate <- as.Date(strDates, "%Y-%m-%d")
plot(TMAX~NewDate, climate_data[1:30106,], type = "l", main="Daily Max Temperature in Portland, OR", xlab = "Date", ylab= "Max Temperature (Celcius)", col="aquamarine4")
bestfitline.lm=lm(TMAX~NewDate, climate_data[1:30106,])
abline(coef(bestfitline.lm), col="black",lwd=3)
```
