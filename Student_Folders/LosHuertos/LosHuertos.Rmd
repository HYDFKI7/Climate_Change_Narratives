## Introduction

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, echo=TRUE}
filepath = "/home/CAMPUS/mwl04747/github/Climate_Change_Narratives/Data/MLH/AGOODA857141.csv"
climate_data = read.csv(filepath)

str(climate_data)
```
