## Overview:
This blog is intended to analyze weather trends in Chicago—gathered from a station at Midway Airport—and investigate how these trends work towards proving a greater pattern of warming.

```{r readdata, echo=FALSE}


# Olivia, you'll want to use choose.file() to find your path and paste it below, then uncomment it so it over-writes mine...
#file.choose()
filepath = "/home/CAMPUS/ocma2018/Climate_Change_Narratives/Data/FA20/olivia_chicagomidway_data.csv"
climate_data = read.csv(filepath) 
strDates <- as.character(climate_data$DATE)
climate_data$NewDate <- as.Date(strDates, "%Y-%m-%d")
```


## Data From 1940 to 2020
The pink line represents a line of best fit, with "TMAX" meaning max temperature, and "YEAR" meaning the year over which the data was gathered.



```{r plotdailydata}
plot(TMAX~NewDate, data=climate_data, ty='l')



TMAX.lm = lm(TMAX ~ NewDate, data=climate_data) 


slopeintercept = coef(TMAX.lm)
abline(coef(TMAX.lm), col = 'pink') 
```
