## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r readdata, echo=FALSE}
#filepath from marc's username...
filepath = "/home/CAMPUS/mwl04747/github/Climate_Change_Narratives/Data/FA20/olivia_chicagomidway_data.csv"

# Olivia, you'll want to use choose.file() to find your path and paste it below, then uncomment it so it over-writes mine...
#filepath = ???
climate_data = read.csv(filepath) 
strDates <- as.character(climate_data$DATE)
climate_data$NewDate <- as.Date(strDates, "%Y-%m-%d")
```


## Create graphic

I created a new section for the plotting, then could "echo=FALSE" the other section since it works... :-)

```{r plotdailydata}
plot(TMAX~NewDate, data=climate_data, ty='l')

# Create linear Model
#TMAX.lm = lm(TMAX ~ DATE, data=climate_data) # Olivia -- we went to all the trouble to create a new variable, but you used the old one :-) see below...

TMAX.lm = lm(TMAX ~ NewDate, data=climate_data) # Olivia -- we went to all the trouble to create a new variable, but you used the old one :-) see below...



slopeintercept = coef(TMAX.lm)
abline(coef(TMAX.lm)) # I suggest you change the color to make it stand out better...
```
