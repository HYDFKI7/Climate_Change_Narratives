```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

I don't know what this does up there ^

```{}
read.csv("/home/CAMPUS/kmsa2017/Climate_Change_Narratives/Student_Folders/Swiere/Swiere_OrangeTX_Data.csv")

strDates <- as.character(climate_data$DATE)
climate_data$NewDate <- as.Date(strDates, "%Y-%m-%d")
```

Words words words. I think my plot should be appearing in the knit file, I'm not sure why it isn't. 

```
plot(TMAX~DATE, climate_data, main = "Temperature in Orange County, Texas")
bestfit <- lm(TMAX~NewDate, climate_data)
coef(bestfit)
abline(coef(bestfit), col = "red")
```
