## Introduction

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r read data}
  filepath= "/home/CAMPUS/cemc2018/Climate_Change_Narratives/Student_Folders/Manning/manning_mccall_data.csv"
  climate_data=read.csv(filepath)
  str(climate_data)
```
