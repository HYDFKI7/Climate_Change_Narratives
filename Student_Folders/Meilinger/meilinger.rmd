## Orlando, Florida

Orlando, Florida is known worldwide for being the home to many theme parks, most notable Disneyworld. With ample sunshine and seemingly no bad weather, Florida, at least in theory, makes an ideal tourist attraction. For this reason, it is also known as a state where many retire--26.5% of Florida's population is over 60 (Elderly). However, as climate change ravages our world, especially tropical lands surrounded by sea, this American peninsula is under extreme threat.  Though the state of Florida has always had hurricanes, but over the past decade, they have increasingly occured (NOAA). Individual hurricanes are hard to pin on climate change, but overall trends to them can be attributed to a rise in temperature and increased precipitation, of which Orlando has both (Bennet, NOAA).

**thesis that ill sneak in** Florida is being greatly affected by climate change, as evidenced by its warming climate.

## Data collection
The data was collected from the NOAA station at the Orlando Airport, pictured above. The station has been collecting data since 1892, all the way until the present. From 1974 to 1993, no data was collected, most likely because of the last of funding to the co-op that operated it. With the influx of funding, control of the station was given to orlando Executive, which to this day runs the station. The station has remained in the exact place it is since 1998--it had previously been two separate, but very close locations, moving the first time in 1929 after being in the same spot since 1892 (National).  

This is an image of the NOAA station in Orlando, taken March 23rd, 1999. The objective of the photos was to document possible obtructions of the weather it is to measure.

## Temperature Risings
The amount that Florida's temperatures will drop every day has been decreasing, as shown here by a graph of August's minimum temperature from 1892 to the present. Augustâ€™s minimum temperatures have been rising at a rate of **balh** per year for the past century. This correlation is scientifically very significant, at a confidence of greater 99.99% (with a p value of >.001).
