## Orlando, Florida

Orlando, Florida is known worldwide for being the home to many theme parks, most notable Disneyworld. With ample sunshine and seemingly no bad weather, Florida, at least in theory, makes an ideal tourist attraction. For this reason, it is also known as a state where many retire--26.5% of Florida's population is over 60 (Elderly). However, as climate change ravages our world, especially tropical lands surrounded by sea, this American peninsula is under extreme threat.  Though the state of Florida has always had hurricanes, but over the past decade, they have increasingly occured (NOAA). Individual hurricanes are hard to pin on climate change, but overall trends to them can be attributed to a rise in temperature and increased precipitation, of which Orlando has both (Bennet, NOAA).
**please add more**

**thesis that ill sneak in** Florida is being greatly affected by climate change, as evidenced by its warming climate.

## Data collection
The data was collected from the NOAA station at the Orlando Airport, pictured above. The station has been collecting data since 1892, all the way until the present. From 1974 to 1993, no data was collected, most likely because of the last of funding to the co-op that operated it. With the influx of funding, control of the station was given to orlando Executive, which to this day runs the station. The station has remained in the exact place it is since 1998--it had previously been two separate, but very close locations, moving the first time in 1929 after being in the same spot since 1892 (National).  

This is an image of the NOAA station in Orlando, taken March 23rd, 1999. The objective of the photos was to document possible obtructions of the weather it is to measure.

## Temperature Risings
The amount that Florida's temperatures will drop every day has been decreasing, as shown here by a graph of August's minimum temperature from 1892 to the present. Augustâ€™s minimum temperatures is rising at a rate of 1.75 degrees celsius per century. This correlation is scientifically very significant, at a confidence of greater 99.99% (with a p value of less than .001).

This change is occuring throughout the whole year, though the change is more pronounced in mid to late summer.

For example, January has the least significant correlation between temperature minimums and the year. It still has an upward trend of 0.68 degrees celsius per century, which, while not necessarily as incredibly alarming (especially at its 79% confidence inerval) is still an amount that is unsustainable. 

Moreover, if you take February, it is shown to be rising at a rate of 2.67 celsius per century at a confident interval of greater than 99.99%! I dont know how r values work, but multiple r squared is 15% and adjusted is 14%, which indicated some variable causation. **(is this a lie i feel like those are tricky words to throw around)**

## A Happy Ending This Does Not Make
If serious, wide reaching actions are not taken soon, there will be serious consequences for Orlando, and Floridians all over the state. Firstly, hurricanes can be incredibly deadly, especially when you consider a pandemic on top of them, stressing evacuation sites and solutions that previously worked. Every year, hurricanes kill **put a damn number** people. Luckily, damage control can be done to stop this, as most deaths from hurricanes occur from Carbon Monoxide poisioning when people turn to gas stoves after losing power. Having emergency backup generators could solve this. **bitch give me a fucking source motherfucker** However, many other pro
