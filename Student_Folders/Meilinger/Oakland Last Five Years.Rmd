Hello! I looked at PM from a station in Oakland, CA. Here are my results.

```{r,  echo=FALSE, results='hide'}

## A table of some things about the numbers

This is a very crude table of 
Month & mean & standard deviation & N & UCL95 & LCL95 

1.00 & 10.20 & 6.39 & 155 & 11.21 & 9.20 

2.00 & 8.25 & 4.95 & 142 & 9.07 & 7.44 

3.00 & 6.88 & 3.38 & 153 & 7.41 & 6.34  

4.00 & 7.95 & 3.94 & 150 & 8.58 & 7.32  

5.00 & 7.89 & 4.00 & 155 & 8.52 & 7.26  

6.00 & 8.86 & 4.14 & 150 & 9.52 & 8.20  

7.00 & 8.70 & 3.65 & 154 & 9.28 & 8.13  

8.00 & 11.52 & 7.47 & 155 & 12.70 & 10.35 

9.00 & 16.26 & 21.51 & 145 & 19.76 & 12.76  

10.00 & 11.29 & 9.35 & 131 & 12.89 & 9.69  

11.00 & 18.78 & 28.03 & 120 & 23.80 & 13.77  

12.00 & 10.60 & 7.88 & 124 & 11.99 & 9.22 

Some things of not are how both September and Novembers standard deviations are relatively higher than the other months, and how most charts have upper confidence limits of less than 15, excepting the month of September, and all lower confidence limits are below 15, and most below 10, excepting August, September, and November, at 10.35, 12.76, and 13.77 respectively.


## Health Good? No, Health Bad

<<<<<<< HEAD
This graph shows the air frequently has particle matter of smaller than 2.5 µm over the recommended rate of 12 µg/m3. As Wu et al says in *Exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 mortality in the United States: A nationwide cross-sectional study*, having "an  increase  of  1 ug/m3in  long-term  PM 2.5 exposure is associated with an 8% increase in the COVID-19 mortality rate" (Wu et al). Thus, any amount of additional PM2.5 above the recommended amount can have very negative effects on health.
