#*Background*

<center>

![Figure 1. The country of Portugal is located on the western-most coast of Europe ](/home/CAMPUS/btpm2015/Wildfires_img/whereportugal.PNG)

</center> 
##**Towards the Iberian Peninsula** 
###Bordered by the Atlantic Ocean and Spain, Portugal's diverse climate, geography, and ecosystems can be attributed to its unique location. The country is made up of 92,090 km^2^ of diverse ecosystems, approximately the size of the state of Maine. The country's diverse landscape is illuminated by Figures 2 and 3. The former depicts an active fumarole, which is an opening near a volcano that expels gases, and the latter shows a highly flammable coastal ecosystem- similar to those of California, Florida, and Australia.

</center>
##**Why Does It Matter?**
###Over 11 million people call this diverse landscape home which is a problem considering that most wildfires are started by human activity (Rodrigues et al. 2014). For this reason alone, studying natural disasters in this part of the world is especially pertinent. Furthermore, wildfires are costly to manage and prevent, and property remediation projects divert millions of dollars annually from wildfire management and prevention projects. In 2017 alone, over $2 billion USD were spent on wildfire suppression and mitigation efforts in the U.S. and Australia, two locations prone to wildfires (O'Toole 2007).  

##**What's Going On?** 
###In Portugal, wildfires larger than 100 ha in size make up less than 1% of fires but account for about 75% of the total area burned (DGRF 2006)(Figure 4). Not only that, but wildfires in Portugal have burned an area equivalent to 50 percent of the total country area in the past 3 decades alone (Marques et al. 2011). Wildfires have essentially become more common as the Mediterranean experiences less summer rainfall and higher annual summer temperatures due to climate change (Pi√±ol 1998; Pausas 2004; Brotons et al. 2013).

</center>

##**Who Is Responsible?**
###Studies have shown that WUIs (Wildlife Urban Interfaces) are prone to fires because of more risks associated with human development (Silva et al. 2011). Wildfires are not always started by humans though; many wildfires are started by lightning striking tall trees within the canopy (Amatulli et al. 2007). Much of the responsibility for mitigating wildfires lies on forest managers and forest protection services, which are funded by the government.

#*Goal*
##Keeping in mind that wildfires are becoming increasingly more dangerous and frequent, I hope to uncover some of the factors contributing to these dangers. Portugal's diverse forest ecosystems aid in achieving this goal. A major factor contributing to increased wildfires, apart from climate change, is forest management techniques- specifically when talking about fuel load management (Brotons et al 2013). For this reason, exploring Portugal's different forest types can aid in drafting efficient ways to keep wildfires at bay.

***
#*Portugal's Mediterranean Climate* 

###Portugal can be characterized by the different ecosystems across the country. These diverse ecosystems differ in susceptibility to forest fires because they have different physical compositions and structures. A main indicator of forest type is the different heights of the canopy as well as the spacing between each individual plant (Figure 5). These particular attributes are of importance because fires readily depend on the availability of flammable biomass. Furthermore, wildfires rely on dry conditions and high temperatures as I mentioned above.

</center> 
###Rainy winters are dispersed unevenly across the Mediterranean, and hot, dry summers dominate for over half of the year. Much like in Australia and California, wildfires thrive on the prevalence of biomass following rainy seasons. Figure 6 depicts a wildfire in the hills of Monchique; the image juxtaposes the quiet, dark streets of the town with the raging fire on the hill.

##*Data*
###Forest ecosystems in mainland Portugal were identified and described by Godinho-Ferreira et al. in 2005. This data will be used to categorize different forests in Portugal. The following section elaborates on this data as well as its significance. 
***
#*Forest Ecosystems in Portugal* 
###As previously mentioned, Godinho-Ferreira et al. (2005) actively recorded and analyzed the different forest types across Portugal. His team contributed to the Portuguese National Forest Inventory (NFI), and his team's forest data are used to roughly assess relative fire hazards across the country. Using this data alongside the observations and analysis performed by Fernandes (2009), a better understanding of the risks of fire across the Portuguese landscape is possible (Figure 7).
<center>

![Figure 7. Paulo Fernandes (2009) combines forest structure data and fuel modelling to better describe fire hazards across Portugal](/home/CAMPUS/btpm2015/Wildfires_img/article.PNG)

</center>
###Often, fuel load (i.e. available biomass) is the only factor that can be address when preventing wildfires(Agee and Skinner, 2005). Forest structures and fuel models can be used in unison to best identify which forests are most susceptible to wildfires. Thus, giving us an idea of what areas require the most attention and resources.

###The fuel model used here, designed by Rothermel (1972), considers four aspects when determining surface fire propagation. The model looks at general availability of plant litter, herbs, shrubs, and the slashing of plants. This model has been edited and improved over time to obtain a more realistic estimate of fire characteristics for specific fuel types (Andrews et al. 2005)

###Forests across the globe can be physically characterized by their overall plant structures, species population densities, and concentration of individual species across the landscape. More generally, they each have a specific "forest structure". Forest structure is vital because depending on the structure, wind patterns and available fuel loads differ.

##Each of the forest types can be evaluated using three fire behavior descriptors: rate of spread, fireline intensity, and crown fire potential. 

##* Rate of Spread: How fast fire spreads in a specific area

##* Fireline Intensity: Rate of spread estimate x fuel load x heat content

##* Crown Fire Potential: Probability of forest fires spreading from treetop to treetop 

***
#*Fire Hazard by Forest Type* 
### By looking at the four different types of forest structure in relation to Fire Spread, Intensity, and Crowning, we get a better idea of which forest structures have the highest risk of seriously dangerous fires. 

###* Generally, both open and closed low structures have the highest risk of crowning, fire spread, as well as the highest fire intensity 

###* Of the tall systems, the closed structures have higher risks of crowning, fire spread, and higher fire intensity, but these values differ only slightly. 
```{r include=TRUE}
qplot(x = Type, y = Spread, data = Rank)
qplot(x = Type, y = Intensity, data = Rank)
qplot(x = Type, y = Crowning, data = Rank)
```

###In conclusion, these figures suggest that flammability is more closely related to stand structure, rather than cover type. Open structures have a lower understory layer and less fuel loading where closed structures tend to be more tightly packed therefore more capable of spreading fires quickly.

###Furthermore, fuel load is more important than rate of spread in regards to fireline intensity, and crown base height is more important than fireline intensity in determining variations in crowning potential for the different forest types.

#*Future Directions* 
###* Stand thinning and pruning increases fire spread via changes in within-stand wind movement. 

###* Surface fuel treatments can favor fire suppression and decrease fire severity.

###* Vertical discontinuity is vital in avoiding crown fire. 

##With these ideas in mind, the following can be done to prevent forest fires much more effectively:
###* Open and tall forest types can remain as is given that they have low to moderate surface fuel accumulaton as well as low fireline intensity. 

###* Closed and low forest types can have heterogenous fuel conditions, high crowning potential and high fireline potential due to well-developed shrub layers and high vertical continuities within the system.

###* Open and low forest types may be our best bet in mitigating the effects of wildfires because these types of forests have higher rates of fire spread and crowning due to heavy wind exposure and a large vertical continuity. These forest types exacerbate the intensity of wildfires by having more available fuel loads throughout.

##Future studies should continue to look at differences in forest structures across the globe to piece together missing information. Given that Portugal has a similar climate to places like California and Australia, it is a valuable case-study when looking into the future of wildfire management around the world especially as climate change poses novel threats. Forest management techniques are currently employed by governments, but these techniques have shown to sometimes have negative long-term effects, which factor into more extreme wildfires. More research should go towards having a more robust understanding of forests, forest structures, available fuel loads, wildfires, and how these wildfires impact communities, both urban and rural. Wildfires are only becoming more dangerous and expensive, so ignoring them would be a grave mistake from our part.
