# What is Attribution Science

Attribution Science is a subset of climate science that attempts to evaluate the effect of climate change on weather patterns, in particular extreme weather events. Determining the climate change signature on these extreme events relies a wide range of observations and data sources, such as weather instruments, records, and modeling, as well as, historic climate events and proxy data of weather.
