Wildfire smoke causes huge devastation from property damage to loss of life. The study of adverse health effects caused by PM2.5 exposure is especially significant. https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2012JD017627 PM2.5 is atmospheric particulate matter (PM) with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers, about 3% of the diameter of human hair. https://blissair.com/what-is-pm-2-5.htm 

According to the The American Heart Association: 
“Exposure to PM <2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5) over a few hours to weeks can trigger cardiovascular disease-related mortality and nonfatal events; longer-term exposure (eg, a few years) increases the risk for cardiovascular mortality to an even greater extent than exposures over a few days and reduces life expectancy within more highly exposed segments of the population by several months to a few years.”

The EPA on December 14, 2014 strengthened air quality standards to reflect a 12μg/m3 primary annual standard with the annual safety 24-hour concentration of PM2.5 maintained at 35.4 μg/m3. PM2.5 levels above 35.4μg/m3 are considered unhealthy as demonstrated by the 2007 Southern California wildfires.
