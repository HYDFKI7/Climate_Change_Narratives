## Blog Draft

Within our group we had many interests from, health impacts to socio economic factors affecting communities and how fire policy has impacted certain communities. After combining all of our interest, we came up with a group question of, “After a forest fire, is there a difference in the number of cardiovascular and pulmonary hospital admissions among the elderly in primarily white and non-white neighborhoods?” Our null hypothesis is that there is no statistical difference in hospital admissions between residents of geographically proximate white and non-white neighborhoods. I chose to analyze socio economic factors that helps explain the difference in hospital admissions between the two communities. Also, I am looking at social identities at the neighborhood level and how they compare to overarching trends. 

The fire that we are analyzing data from is the Witch Fire which happened in the San Diego County from October 21st, 2007 through November 13th, 2007. The Witch Fire also known as the Witch Creek Fire and the Witch–Guejito–Poomacha Complex Fire, was the second- 
largest wildfire of the 2007 California wildfire season. The Witch Fire burned 197,990 acres (801 km2) alone, however, it merged with the Poomacha and McCoy Fires, where it was then called the Witch–Guejito–Poomacha Complex Fire that had a total burn area of 247,800 acres (1,003 km2). The Witch–Poomacha Fire caused at least $1.3 billion (2007 USD) in insured damages alone, becoming the costliest wildfire of 2007. As of 2018, the Witch Fire is the ninth-largest wildfire in modern California history, as well as the fifth-most destructive wildfire on record in California.
