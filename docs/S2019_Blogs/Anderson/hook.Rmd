In Southern California, the climate is not simply warming or cooling. Thanks to ongoing changes in climate, the rainy season has begun a pendulum effect, swinging from storms and flooding to drought conditions almost yearly in a phenomenon known as 'climate whiplash.' The environmental impacts of this phenomenon are severe, including increased numbers of fires, floods, and droughts plaguing the region. Evidence for climate whiplash, as well as its effects and implications,  are discussed in Anderson's blog: "Fire to Flood: Climate Whiplash in Los Angeles County."
