# Introduction

## Climate Activists and Defining Regional Narratives

Climate change science is complex -- but some relatively simple conclusions can be made: 1) humans are adding more CO~2~ to the atmosphere than the Earth can assimilate; 2) CO~2~ acts as a greenhouse gas and can regulate the Earth's temperature; 3) the anthropogenic sources are warming the surface of the Earth; 4) there is growing evidence that that anthropogenic CO~2~ emmissions are warming the Earth but have differential impacts regionally. 

What are these regional impacts? How are regional stakeholders dealing with these impacts?

As you might guess, every region in the US and beyond have very different narratives and impacts -- as as such, actvitists will  the issues of climate change from different perspectives. 

For our 2020 project, we document how various activists confront climate data and respond in terms of public policy. 

 - Activists might have an important role in defining and framing climate issues at regional levels.

## Weather Records and Climate Trends

Weather records date back to the early 1600s. However, a robust, spatially distributed set of records did begin until the late 1800s and only after 1950, are the records beginnning to cover the majority of the Earth's land surface. 

As Bruno Latour has noted the process to modernize is both uneven and inconsistent [@latour2012we; @pachauri2015ipcc]. And as we look to use weather stations, which had been established answer specific local questions, e.g. when will there be enough water to plant rice or warm enough to sow corn. But as we try to evaluate how the ``average weather" or climate might be changing we learn about how complex it is to use these weather stations. 

# Projects for 2020

## Fire and Air Quailty 

Hook...For example, [LeBlanc (2020)](F2020/LeBlanc.html)...

Utah as a mix of urban (Salt Lake City) and wilderness landscapes that make the impact of climate change ???. [Duggleby (2020)](F2020/Duggleby.html)...

Hook...For example, [Williams (2020)](F2020/Williams.html)...

## Economic Impacts on Agriculture

How will climate change affect prosperous agricultural regions in the country? [Rubin (2020)](F2020/Rubin.html) explores the the ecological and economical threats of anthropogenic climate change to the mitten state, while [Manning (2020)](F2020/Manning.html) evaluates climate change in a small town in Idaho. 

## Hydrology and Farming Impacts

Climate change will not only change temperatures, but also rainfall patterns. In rural communities, which are often rely on agriculture, changes in rainfall and streamflow can have imporant impact on relative properity of the community. For example, After observing frequent and severe flooding of the Des Plaines River near her home in Libertyville, Illinois, [Burns (2020)](F2020/Burns.html) analyzed peak annual flow rates of the river over sixty years to determine if the rivershed has become more overwhelmed after heavy rain.  

## The South

[Swiere (2020)](F2020/Swiere.html) documents the impact on climate in Texas and why we should care... :-)

## New England

[Hoffsten (2020)](F2020/Hoffsten.html) explores the impact of climate change on Maine's environment and social and economic infrastructure and advocates for the orientation of Indigenous narratives within climate conversations.

## Urban Heat, Health, Environmental Justice

For example, Chicago should expect to have an increase in temperture, which is further exaxperated by the heat island effectd [(McGrath 2020)](F2020/McGrath.html). Similarly, residents of Los Angeles have been experiences warming that includes a strong signal for climate change [(Marsh 2020)](F2020/Marsh.html).

Climate change has specific and differential impacts on health outcomes and in many case, fall disporportionately on vulnerable populations. [Plancarte (2020)](F2020/Plancarte.html) documents how climate change has impacted San Diego, CA with increasing heat. [Greene (2020)](F2020/Greene.html) follows a similar thread for Washington D.C. where...something interesting to say... In contrast, [Tahbaz (2020)](F2020/Tahbaz.html) evaluates the non-intuitive impact of snow events in NYC and it's social justice implications. 

## Tropical Areas in the USA

Tropical areas in the US have also experienced climate change. For example, [Waring (2020)](F2020/Waring.html) explores the various effects of global warming as well as Native Hawaiian climate change activists and environmental injustice issues. [Meilenger (2020)](F2020/Meilenger.html) describes the changes in Orlando Florida...

## Parallel issues in Europe and Asia

Europeans have also reason to pay attention, [Bisaga (2020)](F2020/Bisaga.html) documents potential climate impacts in Poland.

Southeast Asia has also been experiences climate change. [Nguyen (2020)](F2020/Nguyen.html) describes the issues associated in Vietnam.
