# 2018 Fire Season

After the late autumn fires of 2017, the notion of a fire season in California is at best questionable. Fire season is all year around. And when the summer arrived in 2018, the fire season was exceptional distructive again. The questions we address in these set of blogs, "what is the cause of these intense fires?" and "what are some of the implications for the Earth's inhabitants?"


## Climate, Radiative Forcing, and Carbon Dioxide

Although the Earth's climate has been changing for hundreds of thousands, even millions and billions of years, even small changes to the Earth's average temperatures has significant implications for human activities. Climate change science can be extremely complex, but there are some simple conclusions that we can draw:

## Fire Science -- Climate, Forestry, and Public Health

The EA30 class of the 2018 Fall, evaluate a range of questions associated with climate and fires. These included...

We evalaute the potential for regional impacts and document the evidence of potential changes. We spent six weeks learning how scientists evaluate the earth's climate systems. For example, we learned some skills used to determine if the Earth's temperature has changed, while appreciating sources of uncertainty. 

Each student-team selected a region and topic...

we reviewed the scientific literature to evaluate the implications of climate change relevent to the region in question. 

Finally, we combined this information into a series of blogs that might be used to help understand local and regional climate change implications. Please reading the blogs that you find of interest.
