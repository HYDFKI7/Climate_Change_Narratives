# Introduction

## Weather Records and Climate Trends

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.margin = TRUE, out.width='100%', fig.cap='Tribute photo for Ken Saro Wiwa anniversary. Reflection in polluted river of local activist who follows in Ken"s footsteps, Kegbara- dere community Luka Tomac/Friends of the Earth International. Taken 5 November 2015.

However, as Bruno Latour has noted the process to modernize is both uneven and inconsistent [@latour2012we; @pachauri2015ipcc]. And as we look to use weather stations, which had been established answer specific local questions, e.g. when will there be enough water to plant rice or warm enough to sow corn. But as we try to evaluate how the ``average weather" or climate might be changing we learn about how complex it is to use these weather stations.
