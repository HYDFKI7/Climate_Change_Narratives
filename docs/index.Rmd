# Introduction

## Climate Activists and Defining Regional Narratives

 - Climate activists come on many flavors
 - Activists might have an important role in defining and framing climate issues at regional levels.

## Weather Records and Climate Trends

As Bruno Latour has noted the process to modernize is both uneven and inconsistent [@latour2012we; @pachauri2015ipcc]. And as we look to use weather stations, which had been established answer specific local questions, e.g. when will there be enough water to plant rice or warm enough to sow corn. But as we try to evaluate how the ``average weather" or climate might be changing we learn about how complex it is to use these weather stations.
