# Introduction

## Climate Activists and Defining Regional Narratives

 - Climate activists come on many flavors
 - Activists might have an important role in defining and framing climate issues at regional levels.

## Weather Records and Climate Trends

As Bruno Latour has noted the process to modernize is both uneven and inconsistent [@latour2012we; @pachauri2015ipcc]. And as we look to use weather stations, which had been established answer specific local questions, e.g. when will there be enough water to plant rice or warm enough to sow corn. But as we try to evaluate how the ``average weather" or climate might be changing we learn about how complex it is to use these weather stations.

[Plancarte (2020)](F2020/Plancarte.html) documents how climate change has impacted San Diego, CA with increasing heat. [Greene 2020)](F2020/Greene.html) follows a similar thread for Washington D.C.  In contrast, [Tahbaz (2020)](F2020/Tahbaz.html) evaluates the non-intuitive impact of snow events in NYC and it's social justice implications. 

## Economic Impacts on Agriculture

How will climate change affect prosperous agricultural regions in the country? [Rubin (2020)](F2020/Rubin.html) explores the the ecological and economical threats of anthropogenic climate change to the mitten state, while [Manning (2020)](F2020/Manning.html) evaluates climate change in a small town in Idaho.
