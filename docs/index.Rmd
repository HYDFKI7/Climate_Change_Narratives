# 2018 Fire Season

After the late 2017 fires that burned through New Year, the notion of a fire season in California is at best questionable. The fire season is now all year around. And when the summer arrived in 2018, the wildfires were exceptional distructive again. The questions we address in these set of blogs, what is the cause of these intense fires? What are some of the health implications? And how can we managed wildlands better to prevent catastrophic fires?

## Climate, Radiative Forcing, and Carbon Dioxide

Although the Earth's climate has been changing for hundreds of thousands, even millions and billions of years, even small changes to the Earth's average temperatures has significant implications for human activities. Climate change science can be extremely complex, but here are two well undertood proceses: 

1) Carbon dioxide (and other ``greenhouse gases'') trap heat and make Earth warmer than it would be otherwise.

```{r maunaloa, echo=FALSE}
address <- "ftp://aftp.cmdl.noaa.gov/products/trends/co2/co2_mm_mlo.txt"
download.file(address, "maunaloa", quiet = F, mode = "w", cacheOK = T)

maunaloa <- read.table("maunaloa", skip=70)
names(maunaloa) <- c("year", "month", "decimal.date", "average", "interpolated", "trend", "days")
maunaloa$average[maunaloa$average==-99.99] <- NA
maunaloa <- data.frame(year=maunaloa$year, month=maunaloa$month, decimal.date=maunaloa$decimal.date, average=maunaloa$average)
#head(maunaloa)
#str(maunaloa)
#write.csv(maunaloa, file = "H:\\My Documents\\My Webs\\Mauna_Loa.csv", eol = "\n", row.names = F)
```

2) Human activity such as the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas) is rapidly increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in Earthâ€™s atmosphere. Note: Not only are carbon dioxide emissions increasing, the rate is accelerating. 

```{r fig-margin, fig.margin = TRUE, fig.cap = "Observed CO~2~ concentrations (black) have been steadily increasing since we have begun measuring them in the 1950s, with a best fit line (red). Note that the slope or the rate of change is also increasing.", fig.width=3.5, fig.height=3.5, cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
par(las=1)
plot(maunaloa$decimal.date, maunaloa$average, type="l", ylab=expression(CO[2]*~ "(ppm)"), xlab="Year", 
main="Carbon Dioxide Concentration \n Mauna Loa, HI" )
abline(coef(lm(average~year, data=maunaloa)), col="red", lwd=2)
```

Based on these two processes, we can draw the following conclusion:

We should expect the rising carbon dioxide concentration to warm our planet, with the warming becoming more severe as we add more carbon dioxide. But does this mean that we should also expect wildfires to increase as well?

## Wildfires and Climate

Most researchers are loath to make predictions in the context of highly uncertain data. However, it's also useful to consider simple drivers wildfires and how climate might impact them. 

1. Warmer temperatures increase fire hazards. This fact alone should cause us concern. 

2. Warmer temperatures will increase the energy in weather systems. These will probably lead to higher winds; more intense huricanes, precipitation events, and snow storms; and even possbly more droughts. In a nutshell, more extreme weather events that will require new responses. 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.margin = TRUE, out.width='100%', fig.cap='Strategies to address natural disasters vary. While approaches are severely limited political value, many professionals are thinking carefully about the hazards of fires, how to support victims,  and what policies might reduce the risks of wildfires.'}

```


If we take these at face value, we might conclude that fires are going to get worse and more extreme with climate change.

## Wildfires, Public Health, Management

The devastation of wildfires occurs along multiple axes: loss of life, loss of property, loss of ecosystem services, and impacts on public health. Learning from the history of wildfires, is one of the first keys to manage them in the future. 

The EA30 class of the 2018 Fall, evaluated a range of questions associated with climate and fires. First, we some basic aspects of fire science, then we evaluated some of the implications on public health for people around the region. Finally, we reviewed numerous attempts to managed the landscape to reduce the risk of wildfires. 

## Fire Science

We reviewed the scientific literature to evaluate the implications of climate change, fire science. Wildfires tend to reoccur based on characteristics of the vegetation, climate, and source of ignition.

Although climate change is an factor, direct, human related impacts need to become a bigger part of the conversation. After reviewing fire patterns in Griffith Park, an urban park in Los Angeles County, Anam Mehta argues that XXX ([Mehta 2018](F2018_Blogs/Mehta.html)). 

## Public Health

Over the last few years, the health effects of wildfires has become an increasing documented concern. Mortality is the tragic and direct affect.  But there are also long-term effects. 

One of the greatest health risk to residents not in immediate danger is smoke inhalation. For example, particulate matter (PM 2.5) can flucuate above safe levels long after a fire has been contained ([Zhong 2018](F2018_Blogs/Zhong/Zhong.html)). Kania reports that fuel sources can have differential impacts on public health ([Kania](F2018_Blogs/Kania.html)), thus state public health officials should play a stronger role in vegetation management that improve both ecological and public health outcomes. 

Although we might expect hopsital admissions to vary based on demography, Mason Asato did not have a relationship between X and X [Asato](F2018_Blogs/Asato/Asato.html). However, [Gunasti](F2018_Blogs/Gunasti.html) found...

## Reducing Risk and WUIs

How various juristictions respond to manage vegetation to reduce the risk of wildfires depends on several factors. It's obvious that fire management should vary by region, but Das suggested that fire management tools used depend on how patterns land use. As summarized by [Scanlon (2018)](F2018_Blogs/Scanlon.html), a combination of prescribed fire and mechanical thinning may be the most effective way to reduce the fuel load in the years following the managament technique.

For example, [Wilk 2018](F2018_Blogs/Wilk.html) believes that the presence of WUIs and previous fire sites both significantly affect presence of fuel treatments.

Even in other states, WUIs also particularly challenging. For example, [Reyes-Salazar (2008)](F2018_Blogs/Reyes.html) describes how fire suppression and ponderosa pines have created extremely hazards conditions for 75% of the inhabitants of the state.

# Conclusions

In spite of dramatic news headlines, we cannot blame wildfires on climate change. There are however, proximal and distal explanations for the high costs and extensive areas damangaed. Land use and forest management plays a key role -- while climate change is more like a multiplier effect -- exascterbating an existing historic management mistakes and poor land use decisions.
