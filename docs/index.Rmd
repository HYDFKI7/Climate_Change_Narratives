## Weather Records and Climate Trends

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.margin = TRUE, out.width='100%', fig.cap='The ecological communities on mountains can vary with elevation, but these communinities are extremely vulnerable to climange change. As temperatures increase, populations .'}

Establishing and maintaining consistently designed weather stations requires institutional capacity. In many cases, the weather stations are a symbol of and component of modernity. 

However, as Bruno Latour has noted the process to modernize is both uneven and inconsistent [@latour2012we; @pachauri2015ipcc]. And as we look to use weather stations, which had been estalished answer specific local questions, e.g. when will there be enough water to plant rice or warm enough to sow corn. But as we try to evaluate how the ``average weather" or climate might be changing we learn about how complex it is to use these weather stations. 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.margin = TRUE, out.width='100%', fig.cap='This weather station was established in 1881 as part of the construcion of the trans-Siberia railroad . The meteorological station was built by the passenger terminal at the Amazar Station'}

```
For example, starting in 1881 a station in China has been recording daily temperatures, but it is not clear 1) where the station is, 2) who has been in charge of it, 3) what technology there were using to make their measurements [Massari (2019)](F2019/Massari/Massari0.html).

Meanwhile weather stations in remote locations, such as Glacier National Park have been moved so often, that developing a long-term trend might seem impossible [Foster (2019)](F2019/Foster/Foster0.html).

# Climate Justice...

The concept of climate justics has taken on a wide range of ethical frameworks which have been applied to diverse set of political and social scales. Within the nation-state governance anarchy, scholars have attempted to create moral imperatives to address climate impacts on countries that have not contributed to or enjoyed the economic rewards of greenhouse gases emissions. [Bekkers (2019)](F2019/Bekkers/Bekkers0.html) using an ethical framework to argue that the Netherlands should provide assistance to the Marshall Islands as the islands face potentially devastating impacts of sea level rise.
