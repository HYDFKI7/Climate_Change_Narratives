Sea Surface Temperatures
========================================================

- Sea surface temperature (SST) is the water temperature near the air-sea interface of the ocean. 

- Measurement methods include weather buoys, satellites, shoreline measurements, and aboard-ship measurements

- Voluntary observing ships when they report temperature data to the World Meteorological Organization 


Bucket measurements
========================================================

***

- data was compromised due to the cooling of the water within the wooden and canvas buckets after retrieval and before the reading was made

- discrepancies between wooden bucket and canvas bucket measurements due to the differences in the insulation of material between the two.


Engine Intake Measurements 
========================================================

***
measurements were taken at the waterâ€™s intake, before the water is pumped in to cool the engine

began in the 1920s and became more and more common in the early 1940s before World War II 


Satellite data
====================================
Infrared radiation is measured from the top 10 microns of the sea surface and while microwave radiation is measured from the top 1millimeter

Buoys 
============

- Moorings are anchored in place 

- Drifters move through the water

- Have a smaller RMSE than EITs
