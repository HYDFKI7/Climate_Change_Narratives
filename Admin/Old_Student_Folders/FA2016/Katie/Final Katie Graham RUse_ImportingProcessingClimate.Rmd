Barrow is located at the northernmost tip of the state of Alaska and sits entirely on top of frozen permafrost. This small city is home to 4,384 residents, most of whom are Iñupiaq Alaska Natives. With warming temperatures, however, the permafrost underlying Barrow is thawing, placing residents at severe risk of infrastructure damage. In addition to warming permafrost, melting sea ice and glaciers, coastal erosion, earlier spring snowmelt, and reduced snow fall have also been consequences of the recent warming trends.

### Monthly Maximum Temperatures Trends: December, January, and February

In particular, December, January, and February have been affected most significantly by climate warming. According to data collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), over the past 115 years, the maximum temperatures in January in Barrow, Alaska has warmed at a rate of 0.0651892 degrees per year or 6.519 degrees per 100 years. Correspondingly, December maximum temperatures have warmed at a rate of 0.0559809 degrees per year or 5.598 per 100 years. And, February maximum temperatures have warmed at a rate of 0.0485416 degrees per year or 4.854 degrees per 100 years.

```{r December}
plot(MonthlyMeanTMAX$TMAX[MonthlyMeanTMAX$Month=="12"], ty='l')
plot(TMAX~YEAR, data=MonthlyMeanTMAX[MonthlyMeanTMAX$Month=="12",], ty='l') 
December.lm <- lm(TMAX~YEAR, data=MonthlyMeanTMAX[MonthlyMeanTMAX$Month=="12",])
summary(December.lm)

abline(coef(December.lm), col="red")

```

Now, the change is `r coef(December.lm)[2]` degrees/year or `r round(coef(December.lm)[2]*100, 3)` degrees/100 years with a probability of `r round(summary(December.lm)$coefficients[2,4],4)`. We can reject the null hypothesis that there is no relationship, since the p value is less than 0.05. In other words, the observed warming trend is statistically significant for the month of December.

```{r January}
plot(MonthlyMeanTMAX$TMAX[MonthlyMeanTMAX$Month=="01"], ty='l')
plot(TMAX~YEAR, data=MonthlyMeanTMAX[MonthlyMeanTMAX$Month=="01",], ty='l') 
January.lm <- lm(TMAX~YEAR, data=MonthlyMeanTMAX[MonthlyMeanTMAX$Month=="01",])

summary(January.lm)

abline(coef(January.lm), col="red")

```

Now, the change is `r coef(January.lm)[2]` degrees/year or `r round(coef(January.lm)[2]*100, 3)` degrees/100 years with a probability of `r round(summary(January.lm)$coefficients[2,4],4)`. We can reject the null hypothesis that there is no relationship, since the p value is less than 0.05. In other words, the observed warming trend is statistically significant for the month of January.

```{r February}
plot(MonthlyMeanTMAX$TMAX[MonthlyMeanTMAX$Month=="02"], ty='l')
plot(TMAX~YEAR, data=MonthlyMeanTMAX[MonthlyMeanTMAX$Month=="02",], ty='l') 
February.lm <- lm(TMAX~YEAR, data=MonthlyMeanTMAX[MonthlyMeanTMAX$Month=="02",])
summary(February.lm)

abline(coef(February.lm), col="red")

```

Now, the change is `r coef(February.lm)[2]` degrees/year or `r round(coef(February.lm)[2]*100, 3)` degrees/100 years with a probability of `r round(summary(February.lm)$coefficients[2,4],4)`. We can reject the null hypothesis that there is no relationship, since the p value is less than 0.05. In other words, the observed warming trend is statistically significant for the month of February.


Based on the above figures, it is evident that over the past 115 years winters in Barrow, Alaska have gotten significantly warmer. For residents of Barrow, this warming has been visible in the form of thawing permafrost and melting snow, sea ice, and glaciers. The surface air temperatures observed in late 2016 and early 2017 are some of the highest on record, with 2017 marking the hottest January since the late 1920s. While rising winter temperatures in Barrow have resulted in some benefits such as a longer growing season, repercussions have also been making their presence known. 

For one thing, sea ice has been melting, leading to rising sea levels, coastal erosion, and infrastructure and habitat damage. Furthermore, as permafrost thaws, organic matter decomposes, releasing huge amounts of carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. This has transformed the Arctic tundra from a net sink for carbon into a major source of carbon. This is compounded by the growing issue of wildfires in Alaska, which is thawing even more permafrost, and thus sending more heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere.

### Snowfall Trend in February

```{r, include=FALSE}
MonthlyMeanSNOW = aggregate(SNOW ~ Month + Year, BarrowAlaska, mean)

MonthlyMeanSNOW$YEAR = as.numeric(MonthlyMeanSNOW$Year)
head(MonthlyMeanSNOW)
```

```{r February2}
plot(MonthlyMeanSNOW$SNOW[MonthlyMeanSNOW$Month=="02"], ty='l')
plot(SNOW~YEAR, data=MonthlyMeanSNOW[MonthlyMeanSNOW$Month=="02",], ty='l') 
February.lm <- lm(SNOW~YEAR, data=MonthlyMeanSNOW[MonthlyMeanSNOW$Month=="02",])
summary(February.lm)

abline(coef(February.lm), col="red")

```

We can reject the null hypothesis that there is no relationship, since the p value is less than 0.05. In other words, the decreasing snowfall trend is statistically significant for the month of February. This decreasing snowfall trend in conjunction with the warming trend in observed in winter contributes to the melting of sea ice and the thinning and thawing of permafrost.

### Projected Trends

![Figure 2. Alaska is projected to continue warming rapidly. Adapted from: Regional Climate Trends and Scenarios for the U.S. National Climate Assessment: Part 7. Climate of Alaska. NOAA Technical Report NESDIS 142-7](AK_temp_projections_14353_v6.png)

Alaska has already warmed more than twice as fast as the rest of the nation. According the U.S. National Climate Assessment, however, “if global emissions continue to increase during this century, temperatures can be expected to rise 10°F to 12°F in the north.” Even if emissions are substantially reduced, temperatures in northern Alaska are still projected to increase by 6F to 8F.

With northern Alaska being entirely underlain by permafrost, the projected warming trends pose significant risks to northern communities such as the Iñupiaq of Barrow, Alaska. Melting sea ice and thawing of permafrost are likely to create food and water security challenges and increase the vulnerability of coastal infrastructure and wildlife habitat. Many coastal communities, including Barrow, are considering moving miles inland to protect themselves from coastal dangers. However, relocation is a costly procedure and the state and federal government are reluctant to supply the funds. Additionally, moving inland would only be a temporary solution and would not solve the issues of food and water insecurity and melting permafrost as a threat to infrastructure. 

As a result of global greenhouse gas emissions, Barrow and other northern Alaska communities face numerous climactic challenges that are projected to intensify within the 21st century. Researchers and residents worry about the implications of a warming climate and the seemingly inevitable fate of their native land. Every year, conditions are worsening and coastal land is being lost. It is time for the state and federal government to take notice of these communities, to ensure their safety, and to protect their environment.
