Definitions and Methods
========================================================
Radiative Forcing (RF): a change in Earth’s energy balance between incoming solar radiation energy and outgoing thermal IR emission energy when the variable is changed while all other factors are held constant. 

AR5 defines RF as "the change in energy flux caused by a driver and is calculated at the tropopause or at the top of the atmosphere" 
Its units are watts per square meter 

The RF concept is valuable for comparing the global mean temperature response to most of the various components affecting Earth’s radiation balance. This is done through comparing natural and anthropogenic RF values.


What It Actually Means

(Make sure to explain the units and significance of the axes) (also explain the meaning of the numbers)

Contribution of a given gas to RF depends on its ability to absorb IR emitted by Earth's surface and atmosphere = its fundamental spectroscopic properties of the molecule 
RF is effective when the molecule absorbs at wavelengths where the atmosphere is not already strongly absorbing


History and Development
==========
TAR, AR by the IPCC
More refined way of studying GHGs.

Debate about whether climate change drivers should be considered as a 'forcing' or as a 'response' 

Emissions of forcing agents (LLGHGs/WMGHGs) = forcing 

(Solar changes and volcanoes = Natural RFs)

Aerosol-related cloud changes = response

Data Sources and Methods of Analysis
==================

Radiative forcing can be used to estimate a subsequent change in equilibrium surface temperature (ΔTs) arising from that forcing via the equation:

ΔTs = λΔF
where λ is the climate sensitivity, usually with units in K/(W/m2), and ΔF is the radiative forcing.

Human-based emissions are estimated based on two kinds of data:
1. volume of the activity producing the emissions
2. emission factors used to convert the volume of activity into emissions

How Do Human Activities Contribute to RF?
===================

Human activities contribute to trends in RF and ultimately to climate change by causing fluctuations in Earth's atmosphere in the amounts of GHGs, aerosols, and cloudiness. Changing th atmospheric abundance of GHGs and aerosols can lead to a warming or cooling of the climate system. 

Four principal GHGs due to the Anthropogene:
1. Carbon Dioxide: Atmospheric mixing ratio of CO2 has increased globally by about 100ppm (36%) over the last 250 years 
2. Methane: 2nd largest RF of the LLGHGs/WMGHGs. 
3. Nitrous Oxide
4. Halocarbons 


Areas of Uncertainty
===================
-Decrease in the atmospheric CH4 growth rate and its implications for future changes in atmospheric burden - CH4 is removed by reaction with the hydroxyl free radical (OH)

-The extent of aerosols in offsetting anthropogenic RF

-Life expectancy of different compounds and its repercussions to RF and the climate system

-Overrepresentation of future greenhouse effects due to imcomplete description of the atmospheric removal processes

-Water


Politicization of Evidence and Conclusions
===================

-Emphasis on emission implications could be sacrificed depending on what data says about the absorbtion rate of compounds

-New studies regarding non-anthropogenic effects on RF could be utilized to conceal human-induced effects
