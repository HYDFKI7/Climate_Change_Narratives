Historical Development 
========================================================

- Definition: Extreme weather includes unexpected, unusual, unpredictable severe or unseasonal weather. 
- Examples include flooding, heat waves, droughts, and hurricanes
- These events have been happening since the beginning of time
- However, over the last 50 years, NOAA reports that much of the U.S. has seen increases in prolonged periods of excessively high temperatures, heavy downpours, and in some regions, severe floods and droughts.
- An increase in temperature has caused an increase of water vapor in the atmosphere, which will lead to a change in the atmospheric circulation. Warmer temperatures wonâ€™t just inspire dryer soils leading to droughts and heat waves, but also it can lead to an increase in water vapor in the atmosphere, leading to extreme rainfall events, flooding, and storms.
