Review previously written \href{https://marclos.github.io/Climate_Change_Narratives/}{EA 30 Blogs} to evaluate which ones are effective and what you like about each one. 

Select 4-5 blogs and write a summary for each one, describe three things that you like about each one and describe one thing you might improve. Finally, look up one topic for each one that you are more interested in learning and summarize what you find.
