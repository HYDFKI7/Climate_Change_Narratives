% subsection{Climate Science Review}

\subsubsection{Rational}

Learning about climate science requires students to dig deep into meteorology, atmospheric chemistry, physics, biogeochemistry, etc. Thus, learning about the science requires a bit of patience and lots of hard work. 

Using a literature genre, this asssignment has been designed to give you the capacity to be familiar and develop some expertise in one topic of climate change and to become a resource to others in the class.

\subsubsection{Assignment}

Investigate the assigned topic so you can write a thoughtful and critical review of the topics. Be sure to include how data might be used to counter common arguments that critique climate change science. Submit a written summary of your research findings and their references. The paper should be less than 4-5 pages (double spaced). 

Please include the following sections:

\begin{itemize*}
  \item Historical Development.
  \item Data Sources and Methods of Analysis.
  \item Areas of Uncertainty.
  \item Politicization of Evidence and Conclusions;
\end{itemize*}
 
\subsubsection{Submission Format and Naming Convention}
