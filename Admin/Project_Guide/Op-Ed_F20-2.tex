%\subsection{Op-Ed 2}

\subsubsection{Rational}

Successful editorials requires two things: 1) a compelling and newsworthy opinion, 2) engagement with a controversy associated with Climate Change and 3) a mechanism to encourage the audience to read your blog. 

\subsubsection{Assignment}

Select a regional newspaper where you can submit your Op Ed. Learn the format and length allowed for a submission. 

Using the Op-Ed guidelines, write an Op-Ed to summarize 2-3 salient points from your Blog where you should:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Describe regional climate changes and predictions that include ecological impacts; 
  \item Cite instances of how various scientific arguments have been distorted and politicized;
  \item Identify how conventional scientific standards have been compromised and how arguments that might be based on distortions can be countered.
\end{itemize}

Write and submit the editorial that highlights the key aspects of climate change that you discovered and link that to a newsworthy item. Be sure to cite and provide the URL to your blog. Submit the editorial and include the 'proof of receipt' with you submssion. 


\subsubsection{Submission Format and Naming Convention}

Uses the Op-Ed guidelines, submit a draft Op-Ed via \texttt{Sakai} and a separate document that describes the local or regional paper that this Op-Ed will be submitted to and several examples of Op-Eds that have discussed environmental issues in the paper.
