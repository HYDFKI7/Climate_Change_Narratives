#### **How Are Warming Autumns Impacting Fall Foliage and the Tourist Economy In New Hampshire?**

**Introduction**\
New Hampshire is a small, primarily rural state, home to 1.3 million people in the middle of Northern New England: Massachusetts to the South, Canada to the North, Vermont to the West, and Maine to the East. Historically, New Hampshire was an industrial state, with major cities centered around paper or textile mills. However, with the advent of globalization and the loss of most of this business, New Hampshire has needed to rebrand its economy. Today, the three largest industries in the state are technology, medicine, and tourism. The first two industries have strong epicenters which draw most of the state’s white-collar professionals: the Greater Boston Area supports a thriving technology business in the South, while Dartmouth-Hitchcock Hospital near the Vermont boarder employs many top-tier medical professionals. This leaves the rest of the state largely dependent on the tourist economy. Luckily, the state is home to a variety of natural attractions: the scenic White Mountains which offer a variety of hiking opportunities, a Lakes Region with ample opportunity for swimming and watersports, a quaint Seacoast Region, and many of the East Coast’s best ski mountains. Most notably, perhaps, is the state’s famous fall foliage. Out-of-state “leaf-peepers” pour into the state throughout September and October, hoping to witness the green leaves changing to reds and oranges – and spending more than a billion dollars in-state in the process.
