## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE} 
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=5, fig.align="center")
library("knitr")
kable(bagged_unbagged[1:10,], caption="Microplastics in Bagged and Unbagged Lettuce")
```
