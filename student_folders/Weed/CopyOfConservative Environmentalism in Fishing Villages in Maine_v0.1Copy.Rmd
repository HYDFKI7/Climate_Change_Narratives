## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r read csv, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
# I used file.choose() to fine the file name and path of the csv. You will need to change this to your path because it's different. 
file.csv = "/home/CAMPUS/mwl04747/github/Climate_Change_Narratives/student_folders/Weed/ClimateDataOceanTemp.csv"

# This is where Emma's file path will go... below!
#file.csv = ""

import = read.csv(file.csv)
# head(import) # check to see if the import worked.
# str(import)
# names(import)

```

## Fix Dates

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r newdates, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
temp = as.character(import$Time.of.Observation); temp
temp2 = substr(temp, 1, 10)

import$Date = as.Date(temp2, "%Y-%m-%d")

# plot(Sea.Surface.Temperature ~ Date, data= import)

names(import) = c("Identification", "Latitude", "Longitude", "Time.of.Observation", "Air.Temperature", "Wet.Bulb", "Dew.Point", "SST", "Date")
#library(lubridate)

SST.month = aggregate(SST ~ Date, import, mean)
```

```{r plot3yrs}
plot(SST ~ Date, SST.month)
abline(coef(lm(SST~Date, SST.month)))
summary(lm(SST~Date, SST.month))

```
