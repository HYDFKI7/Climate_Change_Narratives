###Goals
It was my goal of this study to determine whether rainfall increased with a rise in temperatures. In light of Hurricane Sandy, it is clear weather events are getting more extreme, and as New York City rests on the coast of the Atlantic Ocean, the flooding caused by Hurricane Sandy was just a taste of what might be to come.



In order to complete the assessment, I pursued the following steps

  1) Download and extract temperature and precipitation data 
  
  2) Assess a change in temperature by celsius 
  
  3) Assess a change in precipitation levels by millimeter 
  
  4) Compare the two for correlation

##plotting the rain values

    plot(PRCP~YEAR, data=MonthlyPRCPSum[MonthlyPRCPSum$MONTH==9,], ty='l', las=1, xlim=c(1940, 2015), main=Months[9], xlab="Year", ylab="Precipitation (mm)")

*I then compared the month opposite September, March, to test for extremes on either end. Data from this actually proved to be even more drastic in its changes.*

####Results


My data shows that, indeed, the temperature in the NYC region is on the rise, which can be linked back to global warming on the whole.
That said, my data also exhibited no meaningful change in percipitation levels, suggesting that increased flooding can be attributed to other factors.

####Other Explanations
Different factors which science has generally agreed impacted the degree of damage significantly is rising sea levels. This can be directly correlated to rising global temperatures.   

</br>

####What does this mean for the future?  


Hurricane Sandy was a wakeup call for many residents and legislators within the New York metropolitan region. Damages cost billions of dollars, and are still in the process of being undone. Projected reports show that Hurricane Sandy is just the first of many similar events, and within the near future another storm of similar magnitude is meant to hit New York again.
With every storm, housing is destroyed, infrastructure is damaged and the city has difficulty staying open. Train tunnels are still corroding from the saltwater of river flooding in 2012, close to seven years ago.
