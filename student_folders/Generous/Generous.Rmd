## Upload data into R

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
filepath =  "/home/CAMPUS/ccgb2017/Climate_Change_Narratives/claireg_spokane_data.csv"
climate_data = read.csv( "/home/CAMPUS/ccgb2017/Climate_Change_Narratives/claireg_spokane_data.csv")
head(climate_data)
str(climate_data)
names(climate_data)
```

## Fixing Dates

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
strDates <-as.character(climate_data$DATE)
climate_data$NewDate <-as.Date(strDates, "%Y-%m-%d")
head(strDates)
head(climate_data)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
